My source code for this project is in the detectron2 folder. Specifically with the detection2/projects/deep_sort folder.

The resulting docker container is hosted online at Docker Hub. To run please do:

$ docker run -it --rm geek0075/pscore:thu_may19_v1

Please NOTE that the above is a work in progress until the deadline for the test elapses. Thanks.
